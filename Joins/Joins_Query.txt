1. My partner and I want to come by each of the stores in person and meet the managers. 
Please send over the managers’ names at each store, with the full address of each property 
(street address, district, city, and country please).
Ans:
select  t.Store_ID,s.First_Name,s.Last_Name,a.Address,a.District,c.City,o.Country from staff s
left join store t on s.staff_id = t.manager_staff_id
left join address a on t.address_id = a.address_id
left join city c on a.city_id = c.city_id
left join country o on c.country_id = o.country_id;

2. I would like to get a better understanding of all of the inventory that would come along with the business.
 Please pull together a list of each inventory item you have stocked, including the store_id number, 
 the inventory_id, the name of the film, the film’s rating, its rental rate and replacement cost.
Ans:
select i.Inventory_ID,i.Store_ID,f.title as Film_Name,f.Rating,f.Rental_Rate,f.Replacement_Cost from inventory i
left join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id;

3. From the same list of films you just pulled, please roll that data up and provide a summary 
level overview of your inventory. We would like to know how many inventory items 
you have with each rating at each store.
Ans:
select i.Store_ID,f.Rating,count(i.Inventory_ID) as Inventory_count from inventory i
left join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id group by  i.Store_ID,f.Rating;

4. Similarly, we want to understand how diversified the inventory is in terms of replacement cost. 
We want to see how big of a hit it would be if a certain category of film became unpopular at a certain store.
 We would like to see the number of films, as well as the average replacement cost, and total replacement
cost, sliced by store and film category.
Ans:
select i.Store_ID,fc.Category_ID,count(f.film_id) as Film_count, 
avg(replacement_cost) as Avg_Replacement_Cost, sum(replacement_cost) as Total_Replacement_Cost from inventory i
 left join film_Category fc on i.film_id = fc.film_id 
 left join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id  group by i.store_id,fc.category_id  order by  i.store_id,fc.category_id ;
 
5. We want to make sure you folks have a good handle on who your customers are. 
Please provide a list of all customer names, which store they go to, whether or not they are 
currently active, and their full addresses — street address, city, and country.

left join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id
left join city i on a.city_id = i.city_id
left join country o on i.country_id = o.country_id;

6. ‘We would like to understand how much your customers are spending with you, and also 
to know who your most valuable customers are. Please pull together a list of customer names, 
their total lifetime rentals, and the sum of all payments you have collected from them. 
It would be great to see this ordered on total lifetime value, with the most valuable customers at the top of the list.

left join rental r on c.customer_id = r.customer_id 
left join payment p on c.customer_id = p.customer_id 
left join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
group by c.Customer_ID order by Total_Rentals desc ;

7. My partner and I would like to get to know your board of advisors and any current investors. 
Could you please provide a list of advisor and investor names in one table? Could you please note 
whether they are an investor or an advisor, and for the investors, it would be good to include which company they work with.

8. We are interested in how well you have covered the most-awarded actors. Of all the actors with 
three types of awards, for what % of them do we carry a film? And how about for actors with two types of awards?
 Same questions. Finally, how about actors with just one award?
